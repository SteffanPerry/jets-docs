The [jeremiahlukus/revise_auth-jets](https://github.com/jeremiahlukus/revise_auth-jets) gem is a port of [excid3/revise_auth](https://github.com/excid3/revise_auth) to Jets.

It's a nice lightweight auth solution. It's simplicity makes easier to understand and in some ways can be better than [Kingsman]({% link _docs/auth/kingsman.md %}), which takes on a greater scope.

Here's a [BoltOps Community Post on it](https://community.boltops.com/t/updated-revise-auth-jets-to-work-with-api-tokens/1093).
