Let's review what has been deployed.

## CloudFormation Console

Jets leverages CloudFormation for deployment, so check the CloudFormation console. You should see something like this:

Jets creates a main parent `demo-dev` stack that, in turn, creates nested CloudFormation stacks. This solves the [CloudFormation quotas and limits](AWS CloudFormation quotas).

It may seem overwhelming if this is your first time looking at it. A nested stack is created for each Job class definition in your Jets project. This allows you to create as many jobs for your project as you wish.

If you look at the CloudFormation stack `demo-dev-HardJob-*` Resources tab, you'll see the AWS resources Jets created for `HardJob`.

Note the `AWS::Events::Rule` and `AWS::Lambda::Function` resources.

## Lambda Console

Next, let's check the AWS Lambda Console. You can click on the Physical ID link of the `demo-dev-hard_job-perform` to take you there. You'll see something like this:

The Lambda function is a handler shim generated by Jets as a part of the deployment. It provides the interface required by a Lambda function. The `Jets.process` ultimately calls the `HardJob#process` method. You can open `app/jobs/hard_job.rb` and see the code we created earlier.

## Test Lambda Function

Let's test Lambda function manually with the Lambda Console built-in Test functionality. For the event, the example payload is fine. You can use anything. After you click **Test**, you'll see an "Executing function: succeeded" message with a link to the logs.

Clicking on the **logs** link takes you to the CloudWatch Logs Console. It shows all the Log Streams for the Log Group for the Lambda Function. Clicking **Search Log Group** and filtering by 1m or 30m is an easy way to see the logs.

Next, we'll make some updates and do more testing.
