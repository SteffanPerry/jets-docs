## Testing with a Browser

It's more traditional to test with a browser. We'll go through a few examples.

To get the APIGW endpoint, you can use the `jets url` command.

    ‚ùØ jets url
    API Gateway Endpoint: https://spsfc098x8.execute-api.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/dev

You can open up the browser and test it just like you did with [Local Testing]({% link _docs/learn/html/local-testing.md %})

The link above takes you to the homepage; you probably want to add `/posts` to the URL to see the posts index.

Next, we'll make some updates and do more testing.
