title: Prewarming
---

**UPDATE 12/3/2019**: AWS has released [Provisioned Concurrency for Lambda Functions](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/new-provisioned-concurrency-for-lambda-functions/) which essentially keeps the Lambda functions warm. It moves the cold start from invocation time to the Lambda function build time. Refer to the [Provisioned Concurrency pricing](https://aws.amazon.com/lambda/pricing/) for cost details.

Provisioned Concurrency is configured via a property on the [AWS::Lambda::Alias](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/aws-properties-lambda-alias-provisionedconcurrencyconfiguration.html) resource. Jets does not yet currently support this. Support will be added in the future. PRs are welcome and will be considered. üòÅ

Jets supports prewarming your application to remedy the Lambda cold start issue. Prewarming is enabled by default. Only [Controller]({% link _docs/controllers.md %}) functions are prewarmed. To adjust the prewarming settings, edit your `config/application.rb`. Example:

```ruby
Jets.application.configure do
  # ...
  config.prewarm.enable = true # default: enabled
  config.prewarm.rate = "30 minutes" # default: 30 minutes
  config.prewarm.public_ratio = 3 # default: 3
end
```

## Rate vs Concurrency

Concurrency can be helpful if requests are coming in at the same time in parallel. Example: The Lambda function gets 60 requests/minute, and each request takes 1 second to process.

* Case 1: All 60 requests come in simultaneously within the first second. The desired concurrency should be 60; otherwise, 59 of 60 requests will be hit with a cold start (in the worst-case scenario).
* Case 2: The 60 requests come in serially each second for a minute. In theory, the same lambda "container" will be able to serve all the requests without a cold start.

The same applies to traditional servers like Puma where you need more Puma threads and processes to handle increased concurrency.

Option | Explanation
--- | ---
rate | This controls how often the prewarming job runs.

For example, with a rate of 2 hours and concurrent of 2, the Lambda functions are called with a prewarm request 48 times after 24 hours (24 hours x 2).

## Public Ratio

The `prewarm.public_ratio` activates extra prewarming for the internal `jets/public_controller.rb`. The `jets/public_controller.rb` can handle serving static files out of the `public` folder. The `prewarm.public_ratio` tells Jets to prewarm the public_controller's lambda function slightly extra. You can tune the additional prewarming ratio higher or lower according to your needs.

Note: Even though you can serve assets out of the public folder directly, using the `asset_path` helper is recommended, which will serve these files out of s3 instead when the app is running on API Gateway and Lambda. For more info about [Asset Serving]({% link _docs/assets.md %}) refer to the docs.

## Prewarm After Deployment

After a deployment finishes, Jets automatically prewarms the app immediately. This keeps your application nice and fast.

## Prewarm Custom Headers

Jets appends an `x-jets-prewarm-count` header to the response to help you see if the lambda function was prewarmed. The header looks like this:

![Screenshot emphasizing the x-jets-prewarm-count header](/img/docs/prewarm-header.png)

We can see that the lambda function had been prewarmed once and called 4 times since the last time AWS Lambda recycled the Lambda function.

## Custom Prewarming

Jets prewarms most Ruby functions in your application with the same weight. If you want to prewarm a specific function that gets an extremely high traffic volume, you can create a custom prewarm job. Here's a starter example:

app/jobs/prewarm_job.rb:

```ruby
class PrewarmJob < ApplicationJob
  class_timeout 30
  class_memory 512
  rate '30 minutes'
  def hot_page
    function_name = "posts_controller-index"
    threads = []
    10.times do
      threads << Thread.new do
        Jets::Preheat.warm(function_name)
      end
    end
    threads.each { |t| t.join }
    "Finished prewarming #{function_name}."
  end
end
```
